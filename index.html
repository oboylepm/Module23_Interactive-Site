<p>About Me
My name is Peter O'Boyle. I am an aspiring data scientist currently studying for a Professionl Certificate in Data Analytics.

Currently I am residing in Dublin, Ireland. I studies Molecular Medicine at Trinity College Dublin and am working with a global clinical research organisation focusing on helping to accelerate the development of new drugs and therapies for those who need them most.

By upskilling in data analytics, I hope I can pivot towards a role in business intelligence.

When I am not working (or studing) I enjoy catching up with friends, watching sports and relaxing with a nice glass of red!</p>
